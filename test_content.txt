Machine Learning Basics

What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables
systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error
4. Neural Networks - Foundation of deep learning

Applications: NLP, Computer Vision, Recommendations, Autonomous Vehicles
